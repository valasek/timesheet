**Before submitting a pull request,** please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/valasek/timesheet) and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. Format your code with fmt (`go fmt`).
4. Optional - ensure the test suite passes (`go test`).
